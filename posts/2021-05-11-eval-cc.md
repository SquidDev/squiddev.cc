Among the many ComputerCraft related things I maintain (seriously, I need to get better hobbies), is a chat bot for
[the 'Minecraft Computer Mods' Discord server][discord]. [FAQBot-CC][gh] started as a small thing to script to answer
questions (as the name might suggest), but now also supports searching the CC: Tweaked docs.

A couple of weeks ago, someone suggested a "Lua bot" - you write some code, the bot runs it, and prints out the output.
A lot of servers have this already, it's just the nature of ComputerCraft's environment makes this a bit harder to get
right - instead of capturing standard output, we need to display a terminal.

Incredibly, someone put together an [implementation for this very quickly][mcjack]. I didn't get a chance to test it,
but it showed the principle was sound.

This last weekend, I knocked together my own implementation[^1] in Java, built using ComputerCraft's own jar, rather
than an existing emulator (see [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1) again). [eval.tweaked.cc][eval], as the project is now known,
effectively acts as any other emulator, but which is interacted with over HTTP rather than a GUI. It receives HTTP POST
requests with a block of code in the body, starts up a new computer and runs the code. Once the code has finished, we
take a screenshot and send it back to the client.

Implementing this all as a HTTP server may seem a little odd a choice, and is definitely rather over-engineered.
However, we need a long-running process to avoid JVM startup times (otherwise the bot ends up being very sluggish), and
using HTTP is a natural way to communicate with such a process.

This does have some rather fun side effects though. It being a plain-old HTTP server means we can expose it to the
world, and interact with it in all the normal ways, such as this fun bash snippet:

```sh
$ curl -d 'print("Just testing some code!")' https://eval.tweaked.cc | display
```

Given this service, the actual Discord bot's job is pretty simple. We find code blocks within a message[^2], and send
them off to be run. The returned screenshot is then uploaded to Discord and we reply to the original message.
