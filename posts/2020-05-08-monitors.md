One of the projects I work on is [CC: Tweaked][cct], a mod which adds programmable computers to Minecraft. Aside from
computers, CC: Tweaked also provides several peripherals including monitors, which allow you to draw text and images to
a blocky screen.

As the mod has developed, people have begun to do more and more with monitors, and made them increasingly
larger. Recently, someone sent me a screenshot of [35 monitors stitched
together](/assets/img/posts/2020-05-08-monitor-hd.png)[^anime] to form a HD monitor, with an effective resolution of
1968x1215[^resolution]. However, when I came to test on my own world, I found the performance was _abysmal_, averaging
7-10fps.

While in small numbers, monitors have relatively little impact, they do not end up scaling well, and even 30 full-sized
monitors can drag the game to a crawl. It was clear some improvements needed to be done.

Before we get into the changes made, it's worth discussing what's going on internally. Each monitor is made up from a
big 2D array of cells. Each cell then has three properties: the character to draw (such as `A`), the colour of that
character, and the background colour. The monitor also stores a palette, which maps the colour of each cell (ranging
0-15) to an actual RGB value.

The current renderer builds up an array containing all vertex data. Each cell becomes two quads - one containing the
background, and another containing the actual character. This is then rendered using a mixture of `glVertexPointer` and
`glDrawArrays`, using display lists to cache monitors when they do not change.

On some graphics cards, this performs incredibly well[^display_list]. However, the screenshot above demonstrates this is
not the case on my Intel integrated graphics.

## Attempt #1: Vertex Buffers
Historically, Minecraft has avoided using any recent OpenGL features (anything after OpenGL 1.3), in order to ensure it
can run on a wide range of computers. This has changed recently, with some OpenGL 2.1 features being optionally
supported and, as of Minecraft 1.15, required.

The most interesting of these features are _Vertex Buffer Objects_ or VBOs. They're a staple of modern OpenGL, and an
obvious choice here. Our rendering code is just building up a static array of vertices after all! Replacing the renderer
to use VBOs produces a dramatic performance improvement.

In the above screenshot, the monitor is not changing at all. However, is the monitor were to be changing every frame,
we'd have a very similar graph to our display lists again.

Every cell on our monitor requires 192 bytes to describe in our vertex buffer. This means every change of all 30
monitors sends dozen of _megabytes_ to the GPU, dropping multiple frames. In order to get faster, we need to start
sending less information.

## Attempt #1.5: Merging quads
One obvious, albeit minor optimisation is to reduce the number of quads we send.

In the above image, you'll notice that the background is often one solid block. Instead of rendering one quad for each
cell, we can merge adjacent ones into a single larger quad. This reduces both the amount of information sent and the
number of vertices drawn, fantastic!

While this  definitely reduces the  amount of data  sent, unfortunately it's a  tiny drop in  the ocean, and  so doesn't
noticeably improve performance.

## Attempt 2: Texture Buffers
One fantastic suggestion, [put forward by Lemmmy and Lignum on GitHub][gh409], was to use an OpenGL 3.1 feature known as
_Texture Buffers_ (or TBOs). Instead of sending vertices to the GPU, we send the raw terminal data and use a shader to
convert this into an image.

This means that instead of sending 192 bytes for each cell, we only need to send 3 - the character and text and
background colours. Furthermore, instead of drawing two quads for each cell, we only draw one for the entire terminal.

Trying this out yields fantastic results. Our terminal from before now renders at a whooping 105fps (this is Intel
integrated graphics remember), and rarely drops below 60, even when updating.

![Rendering 30 monitors at 105fps using TBOs.](/assets/img/posts/2020-05-08-monitor-tbo.png)

The obvious question from here, is how much can we scale it up before it becomes unusable again? It turns out, pretty
far. On my machine, I'm able to quadruple the number of monitors, and remain at 50fps when the monitors are static
(40-50fps when changing every second).

![Our 120 monitor array, with far too much Kaori.](/assets/img/posts/2020-05-08-monitor-4k.png)

These 120 monitors[^max] have an effective resolution of 3972x2330, which I'm fairly sure makes it a 4k display (and
certainly a higher resolution than my actual monitor). The fact that this works as well as it does is fairly
astounding[^network].

This system is not without its caveats. Due to our use of shaders, it doesn't appear to play well with Optifine -
monitors will render transparently. It's possible to switch between systems within CC's config, should you need to. That
said, it's still an incredibly improvement from where we started.

I'd like to give a massive shout of thanks to Lemmmy and Lignum for their help in designing, testing and reviewing these
changes. There is no way I would have achieved this on my own. As always, [contributions on GitHub][cct] are always
welcome!

[^anime]: Apologies for the large number of anime stills in this post. Due to their small colour palette, they make
  fantastic demonstration images.

[^resolution]: The "actual" resolution is 984x405. However, each character can be split into a 2x3 image using
  [Unicode's block elements][box], which gives us an "effective resolution" for drawing images.

[^display_list]: For instance, on NVIDIA chips this appears to have identical performance to VBOs.

[^max]: This is actually the maximum number of monitors I can fit before hitting Minecraft's entity render limit.

[^network]: That said, the network traffic of this is horrific. We don't apply any compression, so it sends a 3MB packet
  every time the monitor changes. Please don't go building this on a server.
